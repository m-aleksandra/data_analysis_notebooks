       "'First off I did manage to find this product for 20 less at the big box store than the price here Secondly this product is horribly manufactured  Absolute waste of money  The only thing Ill give it credit for is the assembly instruction sheet is as clear cut as Ive come across in assembleathome baby products  But thats where the quality ends  In the first step I noticed the foot pieces did not attach as described in the instructions and this is because the 3 pieces in question were supposed to be uniform to fit in the same manner in all 3 places  But poor manufacturing threw that uniformity out of the window  One piece fit fine the second piece not so much and the third piece not at all  Theyre supposed to snap into place but I noticed the 3 supposedly identical pieces slightly varied in size on the locking parts causing one piece to fit where it was supposed to but the other 2 not to  All pieces on this product snap into place using the old indented tab system for locking into slots  These tabs are so flimsy and brittle they cracked when trying to snap them into position  And even the ones that didnt crack fit so loosely I have serious choking concerns in how easy itd be for a child to simply pull them loose  Also the little key ring items have cheap stickers on them that dissolve and flake off when you wash them  Another choking concernFinally the musical element to this product the little box with the mirror and 3 animals on it suffers from faulty design that makes it unusable with the product  Every other part to this product snaps into place except for this one piece  The assembly sheet instructs you to sit this piece into place and turn two keys on the bottom side to lock it into place on the entertainment center effectively forming a clamp that locks the music box onto the center  The problem is the gap between the key and the bottom of the music box that forms this clamp lock is just under 18 wide and the slot you slide it into to turn the key and lock it onto has an edge thats a little over 14 thick  This makes it impossible to turn the key and lock the music box onto the entertainment center as the instruction sheet clearly states you should be able to do  Very poorly manufactured  This makes the audio portion of the product essentially useless as a whole  And Id be willing to bet all units of this product suffer from the same faulty form  Im extremely disappointed not only with this but the clear choking hazards I see with the other loose fitting parts and peeling flaking dissolving stickers on the key ring  Will definitely be taking this product back for a full refund  I cant stress enough how much anyone considering this product should steer clear of it  Blatant failure of quality and safety control on the manufacturers part'"

       "'My wife has been sucessful using the pump but generally speaking the pump has numerous idiosyncrasies that you should consider before purchasing it  Had we done more homework we likely would have chosen a different pump  If only you could return a personal item to Babies r Us once youve opened it we wouldMy main complaint is that the pump is not very practical  While my wife expresses a fair amount of milk using the product she obtained the same amount of milk using the Medela pump Symphony  There is a long unrelated story why we rented a Medela pump for 2 weeks but it provided a useful period to compare the products sidebysideIn order of importanceSetup  A lot of parts to plug in connect and ultimately clean not to mention misplace or loose  Medela has this pump beat handsdown on this front  Managing this process at home is a chore if youre pumping at work I would imagine this becomes even more difficult  I suppose this is why Avent dont provide the option of a car power adapter  Avent tries sugar coatingspinning this fact out of the gate in the instructional dvd they provideWhile setup appears difficult at first youll soon become use to it  Yeah you get used to but why should you  You dont with the competing products and just think about having to deal with this in the middle of the night when you are sleep deprivedTubing  As a previous user stated the tubing is not very flexible  Especially compared to Medelas tubing  The tubing for the Avent Duos pumps and the corresponding control cord are bound together from the base up to about 75 the length of the tubes  Medelas has separate tubes for each pump  They are much more flexible and lighter  What does this all mean Medelas product is easier to attach separate and MUCH less prone to tip over  Again bad design on Avents part  Fortunately for the time being as my wife is still at home we dont remove the tubing from the pump itself but I see this becoming an issue once she returns to workTop Heavy  As mentioned in other reviews the pump units are top heavy and prone to tipping  The first time this happened my wife cried  The inflexiblefused tubing exacerbates this problem  If you buy the pump be warned and most of all be careful As mentioned in other reviews they only make base stabilizers for the 4oz bottles  To my knowledge youre out of luck for larger bottles and the reuseabledisposable VIA bottles Keep in mind  using a bigger Avent bottles doesnt solve the topheavy problemWaste  Compared to the Medela pump more milk is wasted using the Avent pump  Trust me every drop counts youll see  It is frustrating to see precious drops going to waste  Milk tends to collect behind the soft petals on the front of the horns  Its difficult and messy to harvest these drops  Also milk pools under the rubber diaphram that creates the suction on the horn  This is the area right above where the milk should drop into the bottle  You think they would design it so the milk flows right in  Well it doesnt it has to raise above the level of separate component you need to plug into the bottom of the horn  The milk that collects here is easier to harvest however by pulling off the cap and diaphram then pouring it into the bottle  Again poor design  Lastly the horns themselves dont seem to be designed with the same angle drop that the Medela ones are so you need to hunch over to compensate  If not this is why milk collects behind the soft petals  Overall the Medela pump is easier to use more comfortable and wastes less milk  Recapturing what little waste there is with the Madela pump is certainly easierNoise  The Medela Symphony product was barely audible  This pump makes a fair amount of noise As another review noted we were expecting it to be quiter  Perhaps the cheaper Medela pumps arent as quite as the one we were usingCollectively these detract from its overall usefulness and practicality  Considering what we paid for the pump Im disappointed in the experience and was expecting a much better product  Im willing to bet youll be disappointed too  Pumping is a task youll need to perform many times a day for an extended length of time  In a best case scenario pumping is a task that you endure  Why make it more difficult than it needs to beOne last bit of anecdotal information that I cant seem to escape is thisIn the SF Bay Area there is an awesome maternity support center named DayOne  Among the many services they provide is salesconsultingrenting of breast pumps  When a new pump comes on the market they ask vendors to provide a few pumps for testing purposes  Avent refused this request This resource center is one of the most influential providers of information to breastfeeding mothers in the area  If the pump is so good why not allow this center to test the pump for a few months  Instead Avent distributes this pump through BrU only  With all due respect the staff at these stores have little if any insight to offer consumers or extensive experience with the pumps they sellCall me a conspiracy theorist but this leads me to believe Avents got something to hide  If so shame on them  This is a new product for Avent and until they solve these problems I highly recommend you consider an alternativeI hope this review did not come across too jaded  It is a strong pump  However this one strength is certainly eclipsed by the many weaknesses listed If nothing else throw out my commentary but take the factors I mention Setup Waste Tubing and overall practicality into consideration when selecting a pump Especially as it relates to where and when you will be pumping  And remember youll need to be pumping in the middle of the nightBest of luck and most of all choose carefully'"
